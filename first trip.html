<h1 style="text-align:center"><u>Our First Trip As A Family</u></h1>
<p>We decided to fly for the first time with Daniel when he was one year old to Romania.<br>
We flew before Passover for two weeks.<br>
In the first week we went to the mountains and in the second week we spent the time in Bukarest,<br>
we visited in a water park twice and Daniel had a great time there.<br>
Of course it's complicated to travel for a long trip with a baby, overall we had a lot of fun</p><br>
