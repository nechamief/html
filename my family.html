<p style="padding:50px">I met my husband through a religious dating site called "Third of Heaven".<br>
We dated for a year and then decided to get married.<br>
After the wedding we planned to fly to Thailand for our honeymoon but then the corona virus came and disrupted the plans so we stayed in Israel.<br>
About a year after the wedding, Daniel was born and we could only dream of Thailand for a few more good years.</p>
