<h1 class="red"><u>Daniel's circumcision ceremony</u></h1>
<p>At the age of eight days, we performed a circumcision ceremony for Daniel in a family event<br>
that was limited due to the outbreak of the Corona virus at the time.</p>

<h2><u>Pedyon the son of Daniel</u></h2>

<p>Daniel is our eldest child,<br>
so at the age of one month we held a redemption ceremony for him.</p><br>
