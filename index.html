My name is Nechamie Friedles <br>
I am 27 years old <br>
I work as a nurse in the women's ward at Ma'ainei Hayshuah Hospital in Bney Brak. <br>
I grew up in Modi'in Ilit and later I moved to Jerusalem and lived in an apartment with some friends.<br>
After the wedding I moved to Bnei Berk, it is not clear how it happened<br>
and next year we will move to Beit Aryeh settlement.<br><br>
<h2><b><u>My Hobbies</u></b></h2>
I like to travel and read a lot although I don't have that much time for that unfortunately
